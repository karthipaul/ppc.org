        <h1>ANTANTULLA APPAM</h1>
        <h2>AUGUST 07 SATURDAY 2021</h2>
        <h3>HOLINESS IN WORK!</h3>
      <h3>“Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (I Corinthians 10:31).</h3>
      <p>Whatever you do, keep trying to do it with holiness. Since it is our loving God who gave you that assignment, do the same truthfully and honestly. In the Old Testament, there is a verse that says, “In that day ‘Holiness to the Lord’ shall be engraved on the bells of the horses. The pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar” (Zechariah 14:20).
    <br><br>
      It says that the term ‘Holiness to the Lord’ should be engraved in the bells of the horses. Generally, the horse is an animal used in battles. It is also used for pulling carts and in farming lands. This act indicates the works you do outside your home. This verse also says that the pots in the temples of Jerusalem should be holy for the Lord of hosts. This practice indicates that holiness outside the home is not enough and the works carried out at home also should reflect holiness. The work you do may be related to the world or to the Lord, but holiness should be there in everything you do.
      <br><br>
      Even while cleaning the floor of your home, let your heart repeatedly say ‘Lord, wash my heart and make it holy.’ Even while maintaining the plants in your garden, seek God ‘Lord, make me a fruit yielding plant.’ You may be holding the post of a doctor or an engineer, or you might be involved in some business venture. Whatever maybe your work, let the world see that you worship the living God through the holiness in all your deeds.
      <br><br>
      In our country, lakhs of people are in poverty due to unemployment. But, God is graciously feeding you with everything. Is it not a must for you to remain as a witness to Him in your place of work?
      <br><br>
      Even while in this world, Jesus kept on working continuously. He worked hard as a carpenter until becoming a youth. When He came to do God’s work also, He did it with great enthusiasm. “….must work the works of Him who sent me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work” (John 9:4). These were the words that kept on urging His heart. Jesus Christ experienced tiredness, hunger and thirst, but despite these things, He fulfilled the Lord’s ministry day and night. Dear children of God, firmly resolve to do everything with holiness and act accordingly.
      <br><br>
      To meditate: “Do you see a man who excels in his work?He will stand before kings;He will not stand before unknown men” (Proverbs 22:29).<br>
